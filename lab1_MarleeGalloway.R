###Use Alt+- to generate "<-" with automatic spaces
###Character objects must have "", ex: "ACTG"
###Vectors must be preceded by "c" and put in parentheses

###Exercise 1


x <- 3
y <- 15
x+y
y-x
x*y
y/x


###Exercise 2


x <- 2
y <- 3
x^5>y^4


###Exercise 3


x <- c(22,62,148,43,129)
sum(x)
404/x


###Exercise 4


x <- c("A","T","C","G")
sort(x)
